# Universal Graves
It's a simple, but really customisable grave/death chest mod! 
You can change how every message, block and hologram looks, how long it will be protected,
if should drop items after expiring and alike.

*This mod works only on Fabric Mod Loader and compatible!*

If you have any questions, you can ask them on my [Discord](https://pb4.eu/discord)

## Commands (and permissions):
- `/graves` - Main command, shows list of users graves (`universal_graves.list`, available by default)
- `/graves player <player>` - Opens gui with list of players graves (`universal_graves.list_others`)
- `/graves reload` - Reloads configuration and styles (requires `universal_graves.reload`)

Additionally, by having `universal_graves.teleport` permission, you can teleport to any grave.

## Configuration:
You can find config file in `./config/universal-graves.json`.
[Formatting uses Simplified Text for which docs you can find here]().
Additionally, every message type has few own local variables.
